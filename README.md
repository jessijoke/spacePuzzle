### Installation

This project requires Adobe Animate CC to edit. [Animate](https://www.adobe.com/products/animate.html)

To view the code, select a frame that has an "A" on it, then go to `window > actions` and you'll be able to view and edit the javascript.

To export the game, go to `Control > Test Movie`, this will automatically compile your code and update all the local files, along with launching a server that connects to the CreateJS library so you can test your project.
